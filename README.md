# Semantic-IoT RDF Integration Framework (Implementation 2 - MVP)

This project is an MVP implementation of the second possible design of a **Semantic-IoT Framework**, aiming to validate the feasibility of dynamic integration between IoT data, semantic models, and API interaction patterns. The output is an RDF knowledge graph that links OpenAPI specifications with real-world IoT device data.

## üîç Project Overview

We combine semantic web technologies (RDF, OWL, BRICK schema) with IoT data and an OpenAPI interface to demonstrate:

- Dynamic RDF generation from **OpenAPI specifications**
- Ontological integration with the **http4rdf ontology**
- Mapping real-world data (e.g., thermostats and temperature sensors) to semantic descriptions
- Fully automated and extensible API-to-RDF representation
